# neotest-rspec

[![Tests](https://github.com/olimorris/neotest-rspec/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/olimorris/neotest-rspec/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This plugin provides an [RSpec](https://rspec.info) adapter for the [Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) framework.

## :package: Installation

Install the plugin using packer:

```lua
use({
  'nvim-neotest/neotest',
  requires = {
    ...,
    'olimorris/neotest-rspec',
  },
  config = function()
    require('neotest').setup({
      ...,
      adapters = {
        require('neotest-rspec'),
      }
    })
  end
})
```

## :wrench: Configuration

The plugin may be configured as below:

```lua
adapters = {
  require('neotest-rspec')({
    rspec_cmd = function()
      return vim.tbl_flatten({
        "bundle",
        "exec",
        "rspec",
      })
    end
  }),
}
```

### Running tests in a docker container

This is not yet directly support by neotest, but you can accomplish this using a shell script as your rspec command. See [this comment](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest/issues/89#issuecomment-1338141432) for an example.

## :rocket: Usage

_NOTE_: All usages of `require('neotest').run.run` can be mapped to a command in your config (this is not included and should be done by yourself).

#### Test single function

To test a single test, hover over the test and run `require('neotest').run.run()`

#### Test file

To test a file run `require('neotest').run.run(vim.fn.expand('%'))`

#### Test directory

To test a directory run `require('neotest').run.run("path/to/directory")`

#### Test suite

To test the full test suite run `require('neotest').run.run("path/to/root_project")`
e.g. `require('neotest').run.run(vim.fn.getcwd())`, presuming that vim's directory is the same as the project root.
